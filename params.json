{"name":"Code Docs Codex","tagline":"An archive of revised open source documentation","body":"### Welcome\r\n\r\nThis is a simple stub for [the Code Docs Codex](http://codedocscodex.org). I plan on putting some bones on these bones someday--and possibly even some meat, too!\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\nThe Codex is meant to collect my favorite programming documentation--and edit it thoroughly to make it both legible & current. As it is, so much of the documentation I reference is either out of date or written by monkeys.\r\n\r\n### To Use\r\n\r\nI neither have the skill nor the time to acquire the skill to make a decent website. I'm also cheap, or else I would use [Striking.ly](https://www.strikingly.com) or [Virb](http://virb.com). But not [Square Space](http://www.squarespace.com)--it can go to hell.\r\n\r\nAnyway, code documenation will be maintained on the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/DeadDork/code-docs-codex/wiki). As an experiment, I am going to leave the edit setting on **all**, so don't be a Deuceberg and troll or I'll have to revert & restrict editing to just cool people.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nI will only edit & archive documentation that is licensed permissibly--or at least permissibly enough (some older [software developers](http://invisible-island.net/personal/hackers.html) have [funny licenses](http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses-license.html) that hover in a gray area I'm not lawyer enough to understand).\r\n\r\nIf some documentation isn't explicitly licensed for at least non-commercial copy & revision, I will make a good faith effort to obtain such a license from the copyright holder. If I can't get ahold of the copyright holder, then I will consider the work orphaned, license the work as open source in the name of the copyright holder, and respect whatever her wishes might be should she contact me requesting I do otherwise. In such a case or if I succeed in getting ahold of the copyright holder but she doesn't permit me permission to edit & archive the work, I will try to create original open source documentation to fill that gap.\r\n\r\nRegardless, all documentation is licensed **exactly** the same as it is licensed by the copyright holder.\r\n\r\nWhat I am copyright holder to, though, is licensed broadly under an [MIT license](https://github.com/DeadDork/code-docs-codex/blob/master/MIT.license).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
