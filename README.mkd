Code Docs Codex
===============

Maintain a codex of code docs.

Motivation
----------

I rely on documentation very heavily, but most of the documentation I rely on is outdated, if not outright trash.

As such, I wished to build on the efforts of others, and collect here in an extensively edited wiki format open source documentation I use.

To Use
------

The documentation is currently housed in the GitHub wiki. In time, I plan on making the site much more full-featured, but for now a simple Jekyll page will do.
